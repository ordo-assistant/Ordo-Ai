## 🎯 Project Overview

### Ordo: Risk-Aware Solana Assistant

**Tagline**: Institutional-grade token risk analysis for the agent economy

- Connects to 800+ external tools via Composio
- Multi-agent architecture with LangGraph

**Unique Differentiators**:
1. Only project focused on risk analysis
2. Deep Helius integration for transaction insights
3. Composable infrastructure for other projects
4. Comprehensive beyond DeFi (800+ tools)
5. Production-ready security (TEE via MagicBlock)
